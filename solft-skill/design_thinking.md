# **The Design Thinking Process**
**Stages:**
1. **Empathize** - Understand the needs and challenges of users.
2. **Define** - Clearly articulate the problem you want to solve.
3. **Ideate** - Brainstorm and generate a wide range of solutions.
4. **Prototype** - Develop a tangible representation of your ideas.
5. **Test** - Gather feedback and refine your solution.

# **Empathize - Understand Users**
**Objective:** Gather insights and develop a deep understanding of user needs.  
**Tools:**
- **User Interviews:** One-on-one discussions to understand user behaviors and needs.
- **Surveys:** Quantitative data collection on user preferences and pain points.
- **Empathy Maps:** Visual tools to capture what users say, think, do, and feel.
- **Observation:** Watch users in their environment to see how they interact with products.

# **Prototype - Build to Learn**
**Objective:** Develop prototypes to explore potential solutions and gain insights.  
**Tools:**
- **Wireframes:** Simple sketches or digital wireframes to layout the structure of the product (e.g., Balsamiq, Figma).
- **Clickable Prototypes:** Interactive versions of the product to simulate user experience (e.g., Adobe XD, Sketch).
- **3D Models:** Physical prototypes using tools like 3D printers for tangible products.
